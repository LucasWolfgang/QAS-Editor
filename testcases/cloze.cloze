<h4>Do men really cook better than women?</h4>
<p>Are women better cooks than men because they have a natural love for food and don’t <i><strike>out</strike> - <u>off</u> - <strike>in</strike> - <strike>up</strike></i>? Or are men better because they {1:MC:~=take~hold~think~have} cooking more seriously? Maybe it has {1:MC:~=nothing~some~anything~none} to do with nature—women may be more instinctive, have a better {1:MC:~instinct~feeling~=sense~touch} of smell and a greater understanding of food. {1:MC:~Moreover~In addiction~Also~=However}, there are other things to take into account when to do with nature - women may be more instinctive, have considering cooking as a career. Restaurant kitchens are still a man’s world. Yet, {1:MC:~in spite~though~=despite~whether} the fact that the work is physical and stressful, women are calmer in the kitchen, and often have a different attitude; they cook to show they enjoy {1:MC:~giving~looking~making~=taking} care of others. As one said, ‘{1:MC:~Conversely~Fortunately~=Naturally~Hopefully} I’d love to run my own restaurant, and I’m sure it would be very rewarding, but I’d {1:MC:~prefer~better~=rather~fairly} teach people to be good home cooks. That’s the way to create a love of cooking in future generations.’</p>

<h4>A good show? Really?</h4>
<p>I love going to the theatre but I am often disappointed <i><u>by</u></i> the show itself, which fails to live {1:SA:=up} to my expectations. So what’s the best way to {1:SA:=find} out whether a particular production is worth seeing? Some people read the critical reviews, but {1:SA:=how} far can they be trusted? There are always glowing tributes outside theatres promising a ‘thrilling’ evening, or a ‘sensational’ show, but many theatre managers choose these advertising quotations {=with} great care. This is because they want to {1:SA:=give} theatre-goers the impression that the reviews were {1:SA:=more} positive than they might have been. One musical was advertised with the words ‘the songs remind you of how fabulous the bands were’, but more negative comments were left {1:SA:=out}. So maybe what we have to do {1:SA:=is} read the reviews carefully, but then trust our own judgement about whether we should pay good money to go and see the show.</p>
